# Record-Keeper-React
App is available for you to use @ https://react-record-keeper.netlify.app/

This is a simple Record-Kepper which is built using React. I have used the Material UI for Stack and Icons, React UseState Hooks, Props, Components and JavaScript Slice method to do the operation. Built for my personal use.
